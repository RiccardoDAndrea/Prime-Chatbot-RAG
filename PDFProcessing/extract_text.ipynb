During the first century of the \\nJournal’s publication, medical practitioners could observe tumors, weigh them, \\nand measure them but had few tools to examine the workings within the cancer \\ncell. A few astute observers were ahead of their time, including Rudolf Virchow, who \\nwith the benefit of a microscope deduced the cellular origin of cancer in 1863,1 and \\nStephen Paget, who in 1889 wisely mused about the seed-and-soil hypothesis of \\nmetastatic disease,2 a theory that is coming into its own today (Table 1). Other key \\nadvances were the discovery of a viral cause of avian cancer by Peyton Rous in 19113 \\nand the proposal by Theodor Boveri in 1914 that cancer can be triggered by chro-\\nmosomal mutations.4\\nBut the lid of the black box was not seriously pried open until 1944, when a \\nretired scientist at Rockefeller University, Oswald Avery, reported the results of his \\nbeautifully clear experiments with the pneumococcal bacillus, which showed that \\ncellular information was transmitted not by proteins but by DNA.5 His work led \\ndirectly to the important discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in \\n1953.6 Eight years later, the genetic code was broken by Nirenberg and colleagues,7 \\nand the central dogma of biology was established; that information was transmitted \\nfrom DNA to RNA and resulted in the synthesis of proteins. Then, the first of a series \\nof totally unexpected discoveries disrupted this thinking, and we were reminded that \\nthings are not always what they seem in dealing with Mother Nature. The discovery \\nof reverse transcriptase by Temin and Mizutani8 and Baltimore9, which showed that \\ninformation could be transmitted the other way, from RNA to DNA, had a profound \\ninfluence on medicine but most particularly on cancer medicine.\\nEarly investigators discovered that DNA is a very large molecule that was difficult \\nto study in the laboratory. In 1970, Smith and Wilcox solved this problem by identify-\\ning enzymes that bacteria used defensively to cleave DNA at specific restriction \\nsites.10 These discoveries gave birth to the molecular revolution and the biotechnol-\\nogy industry. They also paved the way for the sequencing of the genome.\\nThis kind of science was expensive. The U.S. Congress partially addressed the \\nproblem by passing the National Cancer Act, which expanded the role of the Na-\\ntional Cancer Institute (NCI), the first disease-oriented agency at the National \\nInstitutes of Health (NIH). The act, which was signed into law on December 23, \\n1971, by President Richard Nixon, created a new mandate for an NIH institute: “to \\nsupport research and the application of the results of research to reduce the inci-\\ndence, morbidity and mortality from cancer.” The emphasis on the application of \\nthe results of research was new; it had not been in the mission statement of the \\nNIH. The act would quintuple the budget of the NCI by the end of the decade and \\nprovide the fuel for the revolution in molecular biology.\\nAlthough the enthusiasm in Congress for eradicating cancer was largely derived \\nfrom excitement over a few clinical advances, about 85% of these new funds went to \\nsupport basic research. At its peak in the early 1980s, the NCI accounted for 23% \\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org on February 11, 2025.

And the results have been explosive.\\nThe discovery of genes that drive or suppress \\ncellular growth and the complex regulation of \\nsignaling systems used by both normal cells and \\ncancer cells to communicate with each other and \\ntheir environment have brought the blueprint of \\ncancer-cell machinery into bold relief (Table 1). \\nThe association of specific abnormalities with spe-\\ncific cancers has allowed scientists to identify \\npersons who are at increased risk for common \\ncancers, such as breast and colon cancer.\\nMil e s t one s  in  C a ncer \\nT r e atmen t\\nExperiments that can be done in hours in the lab-\\noratory take months and years to replicate in the \\nclinic, so clinical advances, though plentiful, de-\\nvelop slowly. Figures 1 and 2 depict the pace of \\nchange for the past two centuries in four areas: \\ncancer treatment, chemoprevention, viruses and \\ncancer-vaccine development, and tobacco control.\\nIn the treatment of cancer, surgery was the \\nfirst tool available. In 1809, Ephraim McDowell \\nremoved an ovarian tumor without the use of \\nanesthesia, the first abdominal surgery performed \\nin the United States, and provided evidence that \\ntumor masses could be cured by surgery. The \\nfirst public use of anesthesia, as reported by \\nJohn Collins Warren in the Journal in 1846,11 and \\nthe introduction of antisepsis by Joseph Lister in \\n186712 paved the way for a cascade of surgical \\nfirsts in cancer treatment in the 19th and early \\n20th centuries. These innovative surgeons showed \\nthat any organ that was affected by cancer could \\nbe dealt with surgically.13\\nThe most profound influence on cancer sur -\\ngery occurred in 1894, when William Halsted 14 \\nintroduced radical mastectomy for breast cancer. \\nHalsted based his operation on the supposition \\nthat breast cancer spread in a centrifugal fashion \\nfrom the primary tumor to adjacent structures. He \\nrecommended en bloc resection of all surrounding \\ntissue to remove all cancer cells, even the head of \\nthe humerus if it was involved. En bloc resection \\nbecame known as “the cancer operation,” and it \\nwas applied to the removal of all other cancers, \\ndespite scant evidence supporting its use. It would \\nbe 74 years before the use of radical mastectomy \\nand en bloc resection was questioned by another \\nsurgeon, Dr. Bernard Fisher. On the basis of ex-\\nperiments in rodent tumors, Fisher proposed that \\nbreast cancer had early access to the bloodstream \\nand lymphatic tissues. Lymph-node involvement, \\nhe hypothesized, was merely an indication of gen-\\neralized spread of disease. Radical mastectomy \\nwas both too much and too little: too much for \\nsmall tumors and too little for large tumors that \\nhad already metastasized. In a series of clinical \\ntrials conducted by what is now called the Na-\\ntional Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project \\nTable 1.

Only about a \\nthird of all cancers could be cured by the use of \\nthese two treatment approaches, alone or together.\\nIt was Paul Ehrlich at the turn of the 20th \\ncentury who first made a concerted effort to de-\\nvelop chemicals to cure cancer. He coined the word \\n“chemotherapy.” After animal models of trans-\\nplantable tumors were developed in the early 20th \\ncentury,29 researchers devoted the first half of the \\ncentury to establishing screening systems that \\nwould reliably predict antitumor activity in hu-\\nmans on the basis of data from murine models. \\nHowever, these efforts were largely unsuccessful. \\nPart of the problem was the limited capability for \\ntesting new agents in humans. Two events pro-\\nvided optimism about the future of anticancer \\ndrugs: the use of nitrogen mustard in lymphomas \\nat Yale in 194330 and Farber’s report in 1948 that \\nfolic acid antagonists could induce temporary re-\\nmission in childhood leukemia.31 In 1955, these \\ndiscoveries led to a national screening effort to \\ndevelop and test anticancer drugs. Then the use \\nof cancer chemotherapy, although shrouded in \\ncontroversy, began in earnest. Missing was proof \\nof principle, already established for surgery and \\nradiation therapy, that drugs could cure any can-\\ncer. Major advances came in the mid-1960s with \\nfirm evidence that childhood leukemia32 and ad-\\nvanced Hodgkin’s disease in adults33,34 could be \\ncured by combination chemotherapy.\\nProof of cure by chemotherapy had a permis-\\nsive effect on the use of drugs as an adjuvant to \\nsurgery and radiation therapy. Doctors started to \\nbe willing to consider using chemotherapy. In the \\nmid-1970s, two landmark studies of adjuvant che-\\nmotherapy in breast cancer were published: one \\nfrom the NSABP, which tested a single drug and \\nwas reported by Fisher and colleagues in 1975,15 \\nand one from Italy, which tested a drug combi -\\nnation and was reported by Bonadonna et al. in \\n1976.35 The latter study evaluated a combination \\nregimen (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and \\nfluorouracil) developed by the NCI but was per-\\nformed under contract with the Milan Cancer In-\\nstitute, despite large populations of patients with \\noperable breast cancer in the United States, be -\\ncause no major U.S. center was willing to test \\ncombination chemotherapy as an adjuvant. The \\nresults of both studies were positive, and the race \\nwas on. By 1991, thanks to the availability of mul-\\ntiple effective chemotherapeutic agents and hor-\\nmone treatments, improved diagnostic tools for \\nearly diagnosis, and intelligently designed clinical \\ntrials, the rate of death from breast cancer began \\nto fall, a trend that has continued.36 Early diagno-\\nsis and lumpectomy coupled with systemic thera-\\npy have greatly reduced the morbidity associated \\nwith breast-cancer treatment, with good cosmetic \\neffects. Such advances have fulfilled the mandate \\nof the war on cancer “to support research . . . \\nto reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality \\nfrom cancer.”\\nThe success of adjuvant treatment of breast \\ncancer, in turn, had a permissive effect on the use \\nof drugs in the postoperative treatment of other \\nmajor cancers, such as colorectal cancer. As a \\nconsequence of early diagnosis, prevention, and \\nadjuvant treatment, the rate of death from colorec-\\ntal cancer has fallen by 40% during the past four \\ndecades.36\\nAnother paradigmatic change in cancer treat-\\nment occurred in 2006, when Druker et al. 37 \\nshowed the efficacy of a drug (imatinib) that tar-\\ngeted the unique molecular abnormality in chron-\\nic myeloid leukemia. This work provided proof of \\nprinciple that treatments targeting specific mo-\\nlecular abnormalities that are unique to certain \\ncancers could convert them into manageable \\nchronic illnesses. Since then, chemotherapy has \\nbecome targeted therapy, and the literature has \\nbeen dominated by the search for drugs to in-\\nhibit unique molecular targets, with recent suc-\\ncess in the treatment of some very difficult-to-\\ntreat tumors, such as melanoma38 and lung \\ncancer.39\\nUntil recently, cancer treatment was a three-\\nlegged stool sitting on a base of surgery, radiation \\ntherapy, and chemotherapy. In the past 25 years, \\nimmunotherapy has been added as an important \\ncomponent of cancer treatment.\\nAntibodies were first described in the 1880s \\nand dominated studies of immunology for almost \\n100 years but had little effect on cancer treatment. \\nIn 1975, Köhler and Milstein developed methods \\nfor producing antibodies by fusing cultured my-\\neloma cells with normal B cells from immunized \\nmice.40 The availability of large amounts of an -\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org on February 11, 2025.

The description of T-cell growth \\nfactor (subsequently called interleukin-2) in 1976 \\nwas a seminal discovery that stimulated extensive \\nstudies of the cellular immune reaction to experi-\\nmental and human cancers.42 The durable regres-\\nsion of metastatic melanoma and renal cancers in \\nhumans after the administration of interleukin-2, \\ndescribed in 1985, represented the first clear dem-\\nonstration that immune manipulations could cause \\nthe regression of invasive metastatic disease.43 \\nInterleukin-2 was approved for the treatment of \\nmetastatic renal cancer in 1992 and for meta-\\nstatic melanoma in 1998. The subsequent devel-\\nopment of immunomodulatory agents such as \\nipilimu mab,44 the development of cell-transfer \\ntherapies,45,46 and the use of genetically engi -\\nneered lymphocytes to treat cancer 47 have provided \\nadditional evidence of the ability of immuno -\\ntherapy to mediate cancer regression. With the \\nincreasing use of these agents, the cancer-treat-\\nment platform sits firmly on four legs.\\nC a ncer  Pr e v en t ion\\nNo matter how easy cancer treatment may be -\\ncome, it is preferable to prevent cancer. But pre-\\nvention has been an elusive goal. Figure 2 illus-\\ntrates three notable pathways to success, with \\ndiscoveries of the connection between viruses and \\ncancer, methods of chemoprevention, and the role \\nof tobacco in cancer. When the cause of cancer is \\nknown, its prevention becomes a problem in mod-\\nifying human behavior. Nicotine is one of the most \\naddicting substances known, and exposure to to-\\nbacco smoke is by far the best known and most \\nfrequent cause of cancer, causing an estimated \\n40% of all deaths from cancer. It was suggested \\nas early as 1912 that smoking might be related to \\nlung cancer,48 with the epidemiologic evidence \\nbecoming solid in the 1950s. These findings led \\nto the Surgeon General’s report on smoking and \\ncancer that was issued in 1964,49 the use of warn-\\ning labels on cigarette packages in 1965, and a \\nban on tobacco advertising in 1970. These and \\nother aggressive, well-publicized public health \\nmeasures, which were strongly pursued by the \\nAmerican Cancer Society with support from the \\nNCI, have led to a steady reduction in the rate of \\nsmoking, which has decreased to half the 1950 \\nlevel in the United States. It takes time for the \\ndeleterious effects of the thousands of carcino-\\ngenic chemicals in tobacco to dissipate, and it \\nwas not until 1990 that the incidence of lung can-\\ncer in men began to decline, followed by a de -\\ncline in lung-cancer mortality beginning in 1991.\\nTo date, the historic goal of creating a can -\\ncer vaccine has been realized only for cancers \\nthat are caused by viral infections. Even when \\nthe causal virus has been identified, the elapsed \\ntime from discovery to prevention has been \\nlong. The human papillomavirus was discovered \\nin 1907, but it was not linked to cervical cancer \\nuntil 1976,50 and a vaccine to prevent infection \\nby the virus in young girls was not approved by \\nthe FDA until 2000. Hepatitis B virus was dis-\\ncovered in 1967 and was linked to liver cancer \\nin 1974. In 1984, it was shown that both hepa-\\ntitis B and liver cancer could be prevented by \\nvaccination against hepatitis B.51 Since then, in \\nsome parts of the world, vaccination of new -\\nborns against the hepatitis B virus has become \\nroutine. Since it is estimated that 20% of all \\ncancers are caused in some way by viruses, \\nfurther development of vaccines holds much \\npromise.\\nThe use of chemicals to prevent cancer (che-\\nmoprevention) can be effective.52 Antiestrogens \\ncan prevent ductal carcinoma in situ and reduce \\nthe incidence of breast cancer, finasteride can \\nprevent prostate cancer, and plain old aspirin can \\nprevent colorectal cancer. However, this approach \\nis not widely used because large numbers of other-\\nwise normal persons would need to be exposed to \\npotentially toxic materials in order to prevent \\nsome cancers.\\nSurv i va l Now a nd in the Fu t ur e\\nTable 1 shows the changes in relative cancer sur-\\nvival rates related to events in science, and Fig -\\nures 1 and 2 show changes in cancer incidence \\nand mortality, with notations in the charts when \\nthe rates of death from a specific cancer began to \\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org on February 11, 2025.

Soon after the development of successful \\ntreatments in the 1970s, disease-specific death \\nrates began to fall dramatically for childhood leu-\\nkemia and Hodgkin’s disease. The incidence of \\nthese diseases was too low to affect overall rates \\nof death from cancer. Overall rates began to de-\\ncline soon after the introduction of better early \\ndiagnosis and preventive measures and effective \\nadjuvant treatment of common cancers, such as \\ncancer of the breast and colon. The 5-year relative \\nsurvival rate for all cancers, which was 38% in the \\nlate 1960s, just before the passage of the National \\nCancer Act, is now 68%. Straight-line projections \\nindicate that the survival rate will rise to 80% by \\n2015.53,54 Overall rates of death from cancer, which \\nbegan to decline in 1990 in the United States, \\nhave decreased by 24% overall since then.53,54 \\nStraight-line projections to the year 2015 indicate \\nthat the overall absolute reduction in cancer mor-\\ntality will be about 38 percentage points.\\nHowever, these projections are almost certainly \\nunderestimates, since they are based on the as -\\nsumption that there will be little change in the \\nmanagement of cancer between now and 2015. \\nMost of the current declines are the result of the \\nwidespread implementation of old technology for \\ndiagnosis, prevention, and treatment, stimulated \\nby funds provided by the war on cancer. However, \\nthe biggest payoff from that investment — the \\nclinical application of the fruits of the extraordi-\\nnary molecular revolution initiated by the National \\nCancer Act — is yet to come and cannot be mea-\\nsured with the use of current statistics.\\nThe  F u t ur e\\nThe sequencing of the human genome in 2000 has \\nhad a profound effect on all of medicine. The cost \\nof sequencing is reminiscent of Moore’s law, with \\nthe cost halving every 2 years.

We prove that these random neural networks\\nare well-deﬁned non-Gaussian processes. As a by-product, we demonstrate that these\\nnetworks are solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by impulsive white noise\\n(combinations of random Dirac measures). These processes are parameterized by the law of\\nthe weights and biases as well as the density of activation thresholds in each bounded region\\nof the input domain. We prove that these processes are isotropic and wide-sense self-similar\\nwith Hurst exponent 3 /2. We also derive a remarkably simple closed-form expression for\\ntheir autocovariance function. Our results are fundamentally diﬀerent from prior work in\\nthat we consider a non-asymptotic viewpoint: The number of neurons in each bounded\\nregion of the input domain (i.e., the width) is itself a random variable with a Poisson law\\nwith mean proportional to the density parameter.

It is well-known that, as N →∞, several such networks with i.i.d. random weights\\nand biases are equivalent to a Gaussian process (Neal, 1996). This result was extended to\\ndeep neural networks with i.i.d. random parameters by Lee et al. (2018). This correspondence\\nenables exact Bayesian inference for regression using wide neural networks (Williams, 1996;\\nLee et al., 2018).\\nMotivated by the tight link between wide neural networks and stochastic processes, we\\nstudy properties of shallow rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) neural networks with randomly\\ninitialized parameters, henceforth referred to as random (ReLU) neural networks .

The parameter λ >0 plays the role of the rate\\nparameter of a compound Poisson process and controls the density of activation thresholds\\nin each ﬁnite volume. The correction terms ( x↦→cT\\nkx+ c0,k)k∈Z that appear in the sum are\\naﬃne functions that ensure that the sum in (2) converges almost surely. This is equivalent to\\nimposing boundary conditions on sReLU. These boundary conditions are crucial in proving\\nthat, under suitable hypotheses on PV, sReLU is a well-deﬁned stochastic process.

The main contributions of this paper are outlined below.\\nRandom ReLU Networks as Stochastic Processes In Section 4, we prove that\\nsReLU is a well-deﬁned stochastic process. In doing so, we derive the so-called characteristic\\nfunctional2 of the process, which provides us with a complete characterization of its statistical\\ndistribution. Further, we show that sReLU is the unique continuous piecewise linear (CPwL)\\nsolution to the stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE)\\nTReLU sL= w s.t. ∂ ms(0) = 0,|m|≤ 1, (5)\\nwhere L= denotes equality in law and TReLU = K R ∆ is the whitening operator for ReLU neu-\\nrons. The driving term wof the SDE is an impulsive white noise process which is constructed\\nfrom combinations of random Dirac measures. The boundary conditions ∂ms(0) = 0,\\n|m|≤ 1, are crucial in guaranteeing the existence of solutions to this SDE. In the form\\nof the whitening operator, K is the ﬁltering operator of computed tomography, R is the\\nRadon transform, and ∆ is the Laplacian (see Section 3 for a precise deﬁnition of these\\noperators). The operator TReLU was proposed by Ongie et al. (2020) to study the capacity\\nof bounded-norm inﬁnite-width ReLU networks.\\nProperties of Random ReLU Networks In Section 5, we derive the ﬁrst- and second-\\norder statistics of sReLU. Speciﬁcally, we present a remarkably simple closed-form expression\\nfor its autocovariance function.

On the other hand, when PV is a symmetric α-stable\\n(SαS) law with α∈(1,2) and scaling parameter proportional to λ−1/α, sReLU converges in\\nlaw to a non-Gaussian process.\\n2.

Early work in this direction is due to Neal\\n(1996) who proved that wide limits of shallow neural networks with bounded activation\\nfunctions are Gaussian processes when the ( wk,bk) are drawn i.i.d. with respect to any law\\nand the vk are drawn i.i.d. with respect to a law that has zero mean and ﬁnite variance.\\nMore recently, it has been argued by many authors, with varying degrees of mathematical\\nrigor, that deep neural networks with i.i.d. random initialization are Gaussian processes in\\nwide limits (Lee et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2018; Garriga-Alonso et al., 2019; Novak et al.,\\n2019; Yang, 2019; Dyer and Gur-Ari, 2020; Hanin, 2023).\\nAnother line of work that is closely related to our setting is that of Yaida (2020), who\\nstudies the stochastic processes realized by ﬁnite-width random neural networks and shows\\nthat such processes are non-Gaussian. The results of this paper are complementary to\\nthat of Yaida (2020) in that our ﬁnite-width networks as in (3) also correspond to non-\\nGaussian processes. However, our work is fundamentally diﬀerent as we use the framework\\nof generalized stochastic processes (see Section 2). This allows us to derive the characteristic\\nfunctional of the random neural network, which provides a complete description of its\\nstatistical distribution (i.e., the law of the process). The characteristic functional also allows\\nus to easily study the limiting processes as the expected width E[Nλ] →∞, which Yaida\\n(2020) does not investigate.\\nIn particular, we derive a novel and remarkably simple closed-form expression of the\\nautocovariance function of the ReLU processes. Another important distinction of our\\nasymptotic results compared to prior work on wide networks is that, in the asymptotic\\nregime (λ→∞), the neural networks as in (2) and (3) can converge not only to Gaussian\\nprocesses, but also to non-Gaussian processes, depending on the speciﬁc choice of PV. This\\ntype of result was alluded to by Neal (1996) in the case of S αS initialization, although\\ntheoretical arguments were not carried out. Thus, this paper is the ﬁrst, to the best of our\\nknowledge, to carry out a rigorous investigation of the convergence of wide networks to\\nnon-Gaussian processes.\\n2. Generalized Stochastic Processes\\nThe mathematical framework used in this paper is based on the theory of generalized\\nstochastic processes (Itˆ o, 1954; Gelfand, 1955; Gelfand and Vilenkin, 1964; Itˆ o, 1984) as\\nopposed to the more common “time-series” approach to studying stochastic processes. In\\nthis section, we present the relevant background on generalized stochastic processes. We also\\nrefer the reader to the book of Unser and Tafti (2014) for further background. While this\\ntheory relies on some rather heavy concepts from functional analysis, it allows for elegant\\narguments to investigate the properties of the stochastic processes realized by the random\\nneural networks in (2) and (3).\\nThroughout this paper, we ﬁx a complete probability space (Ω,F,P). Before we introduce\\nthis theory, we ﬁrst recall some results from classical probability theory.

A prototypical example of a nuclear space is the\\nSchwartz space S(Rd) of smooth and rapidly decreasing test functions. Its dual S′(Rd) is\\nthe space of tempered generalized functions. 3 In order to discuss random variables that take\\nvalues in the dual of a nuclear space, we must equip that space with a σ-algebra.\\nDeﬁnition 1 The cylindrical σ-algebra on N′, denoted by Bc(N′), is the σ-algebra generated\\nby cylinders of the form {u∈N′: (⟨u,ϕ1⟩N′×N,..., ⟨u,ϕN⟩N′×N) ∈A}, where N ∈N\\\\{0},\\nϕ1,...,ϕ N ∈N, and A∈B(RN).\\nWe remark that when N is not only nuclear, but also Fr´ echet, such as S(Rd), the\\ncylindrical σ-algebra Bc(N′) coincides with the Borel σ-algebra B(N′) (see Fernique, 1967;\\nItˆ o, 1984).\\nDeﬁnition 2 A generalized stochastic process is a measurable mapping\\ns: (Ω,F,P) →(N′,Bc(N′)). (8)\\nThe law of s is then the probability measure Ps := s♯P which is deﬁned on Bc(N′). The\\ncharacteristic functional4 of s is the (conjugate) Fourier transform of Ps, given by\\nˆPs(ϕ) = E[ei⟨s,ϕ⟩N′×N], ϕ ∈N. (9)\\nObserve that this deﬁnition recovers the classical characteristic function for random\\nvectors that take values in Rd. Indeed, Rd is a nuclear space whose dual is Rd. Furthermore,\\nfor any ( x,ξ) ∈Rd ×Rd, we have that ⟨x,ξ⟩Rd×Rd = xTξ.

The admissibility conditions in Deﬁnition 5 are rather mild and most\\nchoices of PV (e.g., Gaussian, SαS for 1 <α ≤2, uniform, etc.) satisfy these hypotheses.\\nDeﬁnition 5 We say that the probability measure PV is admissible if\\n1. it is a L´ evy measure, i.e., it satisﬁes PV({0}) = 0 and\\n∫\\nR min{1,v2}dPV(v) < ∞,\\nand\\n2. it has a ﬁrst absolute moment, i.e., if V ∼PV, then E[|V|] <∞.\\nGiven a ReLU neuron x↦→ReLU(wTx−b) with w∈Rd \\\\{0}and b∈R, we observe\\nthat, thanks to the homogeneity of the ReLU,\\nReLU(wTx−b) = ∥w∥2 ReLU( ˜wTx−˜b), (16)\\nwhere ˜w= w/∥w∥2 and ˜b = b/∥w∥2.

After an overview about\\nthe constitutional framework of local self  government and the reform waves of the\\nlast decades, the paper concentrates on the ‘new steering model’ as the German\\nvariant of NPM. The article shows the short history of this reform movement,\\ndescribes the main elements of the reform  concept and explains some of the causes,\\nforces and actors of implementation. It goes on to discuss the present status of imple-\\nmentation, explains several shortcomings of the concep t, and presents the – very\\nlimited – empirical evidence of achieved results. Finally, the paper draws some\\nconclusions from a comparative view on the similarities an d differences of local\\nmanagement reforms in Germany and the two other countries.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nIt has been only ten years since public management reforms were first\\nlaunched within German local govern ment. Many conferences and articles\\nhave sought to balance and analyse th e states of implementation and their\\nachieved results ‘10 years after . . .’. This article seeks to describe some of the\\nsteps and elements of recent German reforms, to comment on some of the\\nachieved results and to assess thes e with a comparative focus on local\\ngovernment reforms in The Netherla nds and in Switzerland. Comparing\\nreforms within these three countries offers the prospect of an interesting and\\ninformative analysis because of the cro ss-country similarities in the reform\\nprocesses. Both Germany and Switzerland borrowed certain reform elements\\nfrom Dutch municipalities, particularly  from the city of Tilburg. Further-\\nmore, Germany and Switzerland – both being (in the case of the latter at\\nleast partly) German-speaking countr ies – took a similar path towards\\nreform and were able to exchange a significant degree of their experiences\\nwith elements of this reform.\\nCONTEXT AND POLITICO-ADMINISTRATIVE BACKGROUNDS OF \\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORMS IN GERMANY\\nLocal government is the lowest of three levels of the administrative system\\nwithin Germany (federal, state ( Länder) and local levels). Local government\\nitself is subdivided into counties ( Kreise) and municipalities or communes\\nChristoph Reichard is in the Faculty of Economics and Social Science, University of Potsdam.'),\n",

Altogether the communes consist of 439 counties (including\\nnon-county municipalities) and roughly 14 000 municipalities. The total\\nworkforce at the local level is 1.5 million (33 per cent of total public employ-\\nment), with most of these being public employees and only a few employed\\nas civil servants (Beamte).\\nLocal government in Germany has a comparatively strong constitutional\\nposition. According to article 28 of  the Federal Constitution, communes\\nenjoy local autonomy (the right of local self-government; see Knemeyer 2001\\nand Wollmann 2000a, p. 917ff.  for further details), and neither federal nor\\nstate government is allowed to interv ene within this sphere. Upper tiers of\\ngovernment have successfully infiltrated local autonomy, however, primarily\\nby delegating more and more duties to the local level without adequate\\nfunding and by substantially reducing the levels of government grants.\\nLocal authorities are furthermore under state oversight with respect to these\\ndelegated tasks and find themselves suffering from the narrow restrictions\\nof state regulations and standards.\\nLocal authorities in Germany have a broad and important portfolio of\\nresponsibilities and services. They implement about 75 per cent of federal\\nand Länder legislation, although – due to  the well-established subsidiarity\\nprinciple – they employ in return ma inly private nonprofit organizations.\\nThese are mostly welfare associations such as the Red Cross or Caritas and\\nare employed to deliver services in the field of social services, child, elderly\\nor health care. Their revenues are derived primarily from taxes, government\\ngrants for delegated services, and user fees and charges. Because most of the tax\\nrevenues are distributed in a revenue-sharing arrangement (Finanzausgleich)\\nbetween all levels of government, the share of locally and independently\\ngenerated income (primarily land and local business tax, fees and charges)\\nof local governments in Germany is comparatively low (about 44 per cent of\\ntotal revenues), thereby significantly limiting local autonomy.\\nLocal authorities are governed by an elected local council and by a mayor\\n(and in counties by a county commissioner [ Landrat]) as the monocratic\\nhead of local administration. As a result of changes in electoral laws enacted\\na few years ago, mayors in the municipalities of all Länder are now directly\\nelected by their local constituents (the so-called ‘South-German mayors’\\nconstitution’).\\nAll local government activities are governed by the general public law,\\nwhich in most cases is legislated at the federal level. The federal framework\\nlegislation is a severe hindrance for lo cal reforms, particularly with respect\\nto civil service and budg etary laws. Local initiati ves to experiment with\\ninnovative forms of human resource management or with new budgeting or\\naccounting instruments are constrained by the strict and nearly unmovable\\nregulatory framework that operates in all parts and levels of public adminis-\\ntration within Germany.\\nGerman local government, then, has experienced severe pressure for\\nabout 10 years: on the one hand it is confronted with steadily growing'),\n",

On the other\\nhand financial resources have been shrinking over the years and any room\\nto pursue local policies has more or less disappeared. Thus it is not surprising\\nthat initiatives to reform public mana gement have started primarily at the\\nlocal level.\\nREFORM WAVES IN GERMAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT OVER THE \\nLAST DECADES\\nLooking back at German administrative reforms in general, we can identify\\nroughly four large waves of reform (Seibel 2001):\\n1. early phases after the Second Worl d War, primarily dealing with equal-\\nization of post-war burdens and with strengthenin g administrative\\ncapacities (1950s and early 1960s);\\n2. reforms under social-democratic influe nce: public finance reforms, civil\\nservice law reforms, territorial refo rms, reorganization of ministries,\\nintroduction of planning and mana gement concepts like PPBS or MBO\\n(late 1960s and 1970s);\\n3. reforms to deregulate and ‘de-bureaucratize’ public administration and\\nto focus more on the needs of citizens (1980s);\\n4. reforms focused on slimming-down the administrative apparatus (‘lean\\nstate’) and being concerned with ‘new public management’ (NPM)\\ntypes of reform (discussed in the ne xt section), but also all the many\\nreforms related to “rebuilding th e East” (transformation of public\\nadministration in the former GDR after reunification) in the 1990s.\\nWhile the reforms during the 1950s to the mid-1960s were not particularly\\nintensive, reforms in the 1970s – and also the ongoing reforms since the\\nmid-1990s – were both comprehensive and vigorous. The 1970s’ reforms\\nhave partly been grouped under the label of the ‘active state’ due to reformist\\nefforts at both departing from old bu reaucratic styles of administering and\\nmanaging the public sector and at finding a new, more active style of policy\\nmaking and governing within the fram ework of the growing welfare state.\\nNevertheless, most of the many reform activities of the 1970s have not been\\nsustainable over time, partly due to pa rty political shifts, partly because of\\neconomic crises and faulty implementation strategies.\\nHaving a closer look at the local level in Germany, we once again observe\\nseveral reform waves offering some similarities to the general reform move-\\nments in the German public sector (Seibel 2001; Wollmann 2000a, p. 920ff.).\\nThese were:\\n\\x7f territorial reforms ( Gebietsreform) in the 1960s and 1970s that led to\\na remarkable amalgamation of counties (425 →  237) and municipalities\\n(24.000 →  8.500); furthermore, there were  some activities towards task\\ndevolution from state to local level (Funktionalreform);'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'PDF_docs/Local_public_management_reforms_in_Germa.pdf', 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='348 CHRISTOPH REICHARD\\n© Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003\\n\\x7f several attempts at strengthening ci tizen participation, for example, in\\nlocal planning procedures, and at  introducing more comprehensive\\nconcepts of city development planning (again mostly in the 1970s);\\n\\x7f some more incremental and adaptive  changes in the 1980s to increase\\ncustomer-orientation (Bürgernähe; for example, the introduction of one-\\nstop-offices, the training of employ ees in customer-oriented behaviour)\\nand to review local duties (Aufgabenkritik);\\n\\x7f the transformation of local government in the new German Länder after\\nreunification in the early 1990s whic h was not a reform primarily but\\na text book export of traditional administrative models and concepts\\nfrom the West to the East (see Reichard and Röber 1993);\\n\\x7f introduction of the ‘New Steering Model’ (NSM) as the German variant\\nof NPM since the early 1990s (see below);\\n\\x7f local constitutional reforms in several Länder, for example, dealing with\\nabolishing the town clerk model, intr oducing direct election of mayors,\\nlocal referendums and recall proced ures, thereby strengthening direct\\ndemocracy at the local level in the 1990s.\\nI n  g e n e r a l ,  i t  m u s t  b e  s a i d  t h a t  t he majority of administrative reforms\\nhave not been particularly successful in Germany (for deeper insight into\\nGerman reform processes, see, for ex ample, Benz and Goetz 1996; Löffler\\n1997; Seibel 2001; Wollmann 1997). While territorial reforms or attempts to\\nstrengthen citizen participation or customer orientation have been at least\\npartly successful, most other reform activities – apart from the ongoing\\nNPM-type reforms which will be discus sed later – did not have significant\\nmidterm or long-term effect s. Most managerial reforms in the last decades\\nhave been concerned with perfecting bureaucratic structures instead of\\nsearching for other methods for co-ordination and control; reforms largely\\nmaintained the status quo.\\nLast but not least, we have to consid er that there are still some remaining\\n‘iron pillars’ of more or less non-reformable elements of the German politico-\\nadministrative system: this is the dominant legalism, the mode of steering\\nby regulation on the one hand, and the traditional civil service system\\n(Berufsbeamtentum) on the other. Both pillars seem to be substantial impedi-\\nments to reforming the German public sector.\\n‘NEUES STEUERUNGSMODELL’: THE GERMAN VARIANT OF NPM\\nRetrospection and schedule of reforms\\nSince the mid-1980s there has been a growing sense of dissatisfaction among\\nGerman city managers with the ma nageability of municipalities within\\nthe framework of traditional concep ts and instruments of ‘old’ public\\nmanagement. The German Kommunale Gemeinschaftsstelle (KGSt) – an associ-\\nation of municipalities for managerial reforms and a think tank for renewing\\nlocal level management – was the major forum to meet and debate over new\\nmeans and approaches for managing lo cal authorities (for an overview,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'PDF_docs/Local_public_management_reforms_in_Germa.pdf', 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='LOCAL PUBLIC MANAGEMENT REFORMS IN GERMANY 349\\n© Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003\\nsee: www.kgst.de/english/set_publicat ions0.htm). KGSt formed a working\\ngroup consisting of practitioners to  elaborate on primary recommendations\\nfor a ‘new steering’, which were published in 1991 (KGSt 1991). Since then,\\nKGSt has been extremely active in elaborating on more detailed concepts\\nand instruments for a new doctrine of local government management\\nlabelled ‘Neues Steuerungsmodell’ (NSM=new steering model). More than 30\\nreports on NSM have been published by KGSt since 1991.\\nSoon after the conceptual design phase, the first experiments in medium\\nand large size municipalities began (for more details about reform phases\\nsee Reichard 1994 and 1997, 63ff). Most of the pilot municipalities concen-\\ntrated on a few elements of NSM and experimented within a comparatively\\nsmall number of departments. Among other such municipalities, three well-\\nknown pioneers of the first experimental phase were Hanover, Nuremberg and\\nCologne. From 1993, numerous communes – primarily large and medium-\\nsize cities, but also smaller municipalities and county administrations – began\\nexperimenting with elements of the NSM. The basic doctrine of NSM in fact\\ndisseminated like a bushfire.\\nAfter a while some ideas of the NSM filtered through into the upper levels\\nof Germany’s public sector. Several Länder administrations started reforms\\nthat were similar to the NSM but not as comprehensive, concentrating\\nprimarily on certain instruments like cost accounting, budgeting or personnel\\nmanagement. Apart from the three city-states of Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg –\\nwhich more or less followed the KGSt approach – Länder like Baden-\\nWürttemberg, Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen have been\\nparticularly active reformers. Yet wi th the exception of some efficiency\\nmeasures, cost accounting activities and debates over new means of ‘activating’\\nand empowering citizens, very limited reform activities along NSM lines are\\nvisible at the federal level (see Jann and Reichard 2001 for details).\\nNot surprisingly, after nearly a decade of intensive reform activities, the\\nenthusiasm of undertaking NSM refo rms has declined, and some signs of\\ndisenchantment have begun to surfac e. For the last three years, NSM\\ndiscourse has been broadened to en compass new and additional topics,\\namong them citizen empowerment and participation ( Bürgerkommune) as\\nwell as e-government.\\nCauses of reform, its driving forces and major actors\\nDuring the 1980s, Germany remained largely unimpressed by the inter-\\nnational NPM debate and began its reform processes some 10 years later, a\\nrelatively late start in comparison with leading NPM reformers such as the\\nUK or New Zealand (Schröter and Wollmann 1997, pp. 190ff.; Reichard\\n1997, pp. 60ff.). There was no particular  financial pressure, at least not until\\nthe mid-1990s. Administrators and po liticians were still convinced that\\nGerman administration was functionin g well compared with international\\nstandards, particularly with regard to legality and reliability of its services.\\nThe specific administrative culture of  German bureaucracy with its highly'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'PDF_docs/Local_public_management_reforms_in_Germa.pdf', 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='350 CHRISTOPH REICHARD\\n© Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003\\nlaw-based tenets added another degree of restrictions. Finally, the language\\nbarrier between the English-language NPM discourse and the comparatively\\nweak willingness of bureaucrats in Germany to participate in this debate\\nwas another reason for the comparativ ely late start on public management\\nreforms.\\nAs in most other countries, publ ic management reforms in Germany\\ncannot be seen as the impact of merely one factor but rather of  a variety of\\naspects (Reichard 1997, p. 63). As already stated, fiscal stress was not a major\\ninitiating factor; most mu nicipalities were in a relatively stable financial\\nstate through to the mid-1990s. Cuts in the budgets first became a major\\nfactor after 1995, as most of the loca l governments began to suffer from the\\ngrowing fiscal crisis that to some extent was influenced by the immense\\ncosts of German reunification.\\nOne of the main driving forces in the initial phase of NSM was the growing\\ndissatisfaction of city managers with the traditional way of managing local\\nauthorities. For decades, these authorities (like all other public sector organ-\\nizations within Germany) had been managed on a pattern of highly-centralized\\nauthority for resource allocation. This authority was concentrated in specialized\\ncentral service departments (treasury,  personnel department, and so on).\\nConsequently, no manager was really responsible for the ‘end result’, covering\\ntasks as well as resources, and the whole system carried a distinct air of\\n‘organized irresponsibility’ (Banner 1991, p. 7). The local managers experienced\\nmore and more difficulties in steering their authorities according to this\\npattern. It was believed that the high degree of ce ntralization of decision-\\nmaking competencies, an unclear dist ribution of responsibilities among\\ndepartmental sectors, and a lack of  transparency and adequate steering\\ninstruments were the main reasons fo r these difficulties. Thus, the first\\nimpetus for reform was concentrated within the intra-administrative executive\\nlevel of municipalities and did not originate from politicians, citizens or\\nexternal forces such as central government.\\nThe NSM reform was largely a reform  from the inside, from below and\\nfrom the practitioners’ front. It was initiated by chief executives and heads\\nof finance or general administrative divisions of numerous municipalities,\\nprimarily medium- and large-scale ones. More specifically, these manifestations\\noriginated predominantly within the states of Nordrhein-Westfalen and\\nNiedersachsen, both of which were under the rule of the British-based town-\\nclerk-model, with its complex and co nflictious decision -making structures\\n(a model which was, however, actua lly abolished a few years ago). There\\nwas no pressure from the state or federal level to introduce NPM-type\\nreforms in German local government. Instead, it was a completely voluntary\\nprocess; communes could initiate or leave the reform process of their own\\nfree will. A relatively incremental stra tegy was also pursued, with long and\\nquite cautious experimental phases. Fu rthermore, at least at the beginning,\\nthere was not much push from either academia or the consultancy industry.\\nBoth academics and consultants firs t joined the already-running reform'),\n",

This also re veals that theoretical and ideological\\ninfluences in Germany – for example, from Public Choice Theory or from\\nthe New Right movement – were rath er unimportant in comparison with\\nthose in countries such as the UK, New Zealand or the US.\\nAs already mentioned, KGSt was a strong supporting force throughout\\nthe period of innovation. Not only did it effectively design the NSM model,\\nit succeeded in disseminating its conceptual ideas through numerous\\navenues (publications, congresses, seminars, own consultancy company,\\nnetworking with communes, and so on). It remains true that the ‘victory’ of\\nNSM would not have taken place without the extremely intensive missionary\\nactivities of the KGSt during the last decade.\\nHowever, implementation of the NSM is also the result of several more\\nsupportive factors. First, public management reform s found positive\\nreception by all major political parties:  the social democrats recognized the\\nNSM as a countermeasure against ma ssive privatization (strengthening\\nlocal services instead of privatizing them); the conservatives were satisfied\\nbecause of its call for neoliberal ef ficiency; the Greens supported the NSM\\ndevelopment because they expected pr ogress in the fields of customer-\\norientation, participation and empowerment. Furthermore, the public sector\\nunions were strongly in favour of  the reform movement, expecting a\\npositive move towards securing workplaces.\\nNSM emerged in the 1990s, primarily driven by German local government.\\nContrary to the broad exchange of vi ews and experiences that took place in\\nthe Anglo-Saxon world with respect to NPM, the German NSM experienced\\na much more isolated development. The international mainstream of the\\nNPM discourse had only limited influence on the design and implementation\\nof NSM. This was partly due to language barriers, but also because of reluctance\\namong German bureaucrats to study foreign reform developments. The\\nhighly restrictive participation of German federal government officials in the\\nPublic Management (PUMA) division of the OECD over the last decade is a\\nstriking example of this reluctance. Local government associations such as the\\nKGSt and some foundations like the Bertelsmann Foundation nevertheless\\ntried to set up and support the international exchange of public management\\nexperiences at the local level, by both  sponsoring international conferences\\n(see Banner and Reichard 1993 as an example of conference proceedings) and\\nbestowing ‘best practice awards’ (for example, the Bertelsmann Prize for best\\npractice in local management from 1993; see Naschold and Pröhl 1994).\\nThe influence of the Tilburg Model on reforms in Germany\\nIn contrast to the NPM mainstream, there was a considerable transfer of\\nknowledge from The Netherlands to Germany during its initial period of\\ndevelopment within Germany. One Dutch city had a particularly\\npronounced impact on the German NSM: the city of Tilburg. In the early\\n1980s, it developed an approach to the organization and management of city\\nadministration fashioned very closely upon the corporate-management'),\n",

Put rather simply, one\\nreason was the relative proximity of T ilburg to Cologne, the seat of KGSt.\\nSecondly, the marketing activities of the Tilburg reform professionals were\\nremarkable (see again Hendriks and Tops and also Shrijvers 1993; Dopatka\\n1995); in addition, KGSt experts were impressed with the stringency of the\\nTilburg model. Third and foremost, the concept of Tilburg did seem to fit\\nextremely well into the first ideas and features of the NSM.\\nThe KGSt decided to elaborate on th e ‘Tilburg Model’ as a master case\\nstudy for the further design of the NSM. In 1992 KGSt published a report\\nabout the Tilburg Model which found broad recognition within the German\\nlocal government community (KGSt 1992) . Furthermore, Fons Shrijvers, the\\nformer general manager ( secretarie) of Tilburg, played a highly influential\\nrole in consulting with KGSt and numerous German cities. During the initial\\nphase of the NSM, the Tilburg Model became something of a synonym for\\nmodern local management in Germany. It  is in fact quite plausible that the\\nTilburg Model garnished greater support and prominence in Germany during\\nthe early 1990s than in The Netherlands itself.\\nKGSt borrowed the following ideas in particular from the Tilburg case:\\n\\x7f the product approach (i.e. descri bing all outputs and services of\\na municipality as ‘products’);\\n\\x7f the integration of responsibilities for services and resources and the\\ndecentralized assignment of these re sponsibilities to semi-autonomous\\nunits (responsibility centres);\\n\\x7f the perception of a city organizat ion – with all of its entities and\\ncorporations – as a holding structure;\\n\\x7f the output- (product-) oriented budget and the comprehensive reporting\\nsystem based on performance indicators;\\n\\x7f the distinction between the strategic role of the council and the operative\\nrole of the administration;\\n\\x7f the internal contract management, i.e. formulating targets and budgets\\nfor certain products in an agreement between the top management and\\nthe different units.\\nIt is of considerable interest that very few in Germany realized that the\\ncity administration of Tilburg changed its basic managerial orientation in\\n1995 from its ‘old’ conceptualization of interest within the German debate to\\na ‘new’ style incorporating a more strategic, citizen-oriented and development-\\nfocused approach (see again Hendriks and Tops for details). Yet the ‘old-style\\nTilburg Model’, with its output-oriented structure and its intraorganizational\\nand managerialist bias, remained influential in the German reform'),\n",

Therea fter, some commentators considered\\nthat it might be dubious to transfer findings from a Dutch municipality onto\\nGerman administrative systems due to the rather divergent framework\\nconditions within the two countries. As a result, the Tilburg Model slowly\\ndisappeared from the German reform sc ene after about 1995; its basic ideas\\nnevertheless still remained within parts of the NSM.\\nConceptualization of NSM\\nFrom its inception, NSM focused primarily on several key issues (see Reichard\\n2001, pp. 546ff.). It was foremost concerned with strengthening accountability\\nby integrating the formerly divided responsibilities for resources and policy\\nissues. This was narrowly related to internal contracting, that is, to establishing\\ncontractual relations between different units of a local authority. Another\\nissue was global and output-orien ted budgeting, which sought to\\nstrengthen accountability through othe r means. Global spending levels for\\nthe different sectors were set by the local council, which were then free to\\nmanage their financial resources within  the set parameters. Budgeting itself\\nwas linked to new forms of accounting , that is, introducing internal cost\\naccounting techniques and reforming the general local government accounting\\nsystem from predominantly cash to a ccrual accounting. Furthermore, local\\nmanagers developed new, more comprehensive concepts for monitoring\\nand evaluating the costs and performance of the different units.\\nAccording to this general outline, NSM in its early years – henceforth\\ncalled ‘NSM 1.0’ – mainly consisted of the following elements (KGSt 1993;\\nReichard 1996):\\n\\x7f detailed product descriptions;\\n\\x7f internal management contracts based on defined products and on\\nflexible budgets;\\n\\x7f integrated decentralized responsi bility for results and resources;\\n\\x7ff l e x i b l e  a n d  p r o d u ct-based budgeting;\\n\\x7f cost accounting (usually still based on cameralist bookkeeping style);\\n\\x7f monitoring and evaluation of results and related costs (in Germany\\nusually called ‘controlling’).\\nAfter several years of practical experience, this first version of NSM showed\\na number of shortcomings. KGSt an d the leading reform communes thus\\ndecided to extend the concept to incl ude additional elements within the\\noriginal NSM framework. Some of the major elements of the second generation\\nNSM (‘NSM 2.0’, from about 1998 onwards) were:\\n\\x7f experiments with some tools of quality management (customer\\nsurveys, etc.);\\n\\x7f (limited) experiments with conc epts and instruments of human\\nresource management (e.g. with re cruitment and evaluation methods,\\npersonnel development concepts, performance-related pay, etc.);'),\n",

They neglected the rather ‘soft\\nelements’ such as organizational change, human resource management or\\nquality management. Most municipalities spent (too) much time and energy\\non the elaboration of product descri ptions. They set up highly detailed\\n‘product catalogues’, consisting of precise descriptions of services, the\\nactivities behind them, legal regulation s, as well as the costs and qualities\\nto be achieved. Although the basic rationale here is rather positive (knowing\\nmore about the services to be produced and using data for benchmarking),\\nthe accuracy of such cataloguing seems to be in some manner ‘typically\\nGerman’, influenced more from the ‘spirit of bureaucracy’ than by the ‘spirit\\nof managerialism’ (Reichard 1998).\\nThough empirical data about implemented reform elements within\\nGermany is lacking, the implementation status of NSM elements at present\\ncan be described as follows. Accord ing to bi-annual surveys conducted by\\nthe German Association of Cities (DST ), implementation during the years\\n1996 to 2000 made remarkable progress (Grömig and Thielen 1996; Grömig\\nand Gruner 1998; Grömig 2001). German municipalities claim to fully\\nengaged in introducing the NSM: from  83 per cent of municipalities in 1996\\nand 89 per cent in 1998 to 92 per cent in 2000 municipalities have reported'),\n",

It\\nappears doubtful, however, that these figures actually mirror reality. Some\\nsubjective impressions show that th ere are big differences between the\\nrhetoric of municipalities and the reality of implementation. The surveys\\nalso show that the core instruments of NSM – cost accounting, budgeting,\\ncontrolling – are the dominant elemen ts being implemented. Additionally,\\nsome activities geared towards better training and development of personnel\\nand several organizational restructur ing measures are on the list of\\nimplemented reform elements.\\nOne of the rare empirical surveys on the implementation of NSM, focusing\\non construction, housing and the envi ronment, has found that budgeting\\ntechniques have been widely implemented, but while product catalogues\\nplay a major role, the use of cost accounting is rather limited in practice\\n(Jaedicke, Thrun and Wollmann 2000). Fu rthermore, in the restructuring of\\nsome local authorities (flatter hierar chies, larger span s of control, some\\nestablished service and result cent res), experimentation with contract\\nmanagement and process re-engineerin g has been observed. However, it\\nshould be noted that a deeper look into these local structures sometimes\\nreveals merely ‘Potemkin’s Façades’ and the renaming of already existing\\n(‘old’) units.\\nThere is clear evidence that communes in the new German Länder – in the\\nformer GDR – are somewhat lagging behind in the reform process. Innovations\\nin local management have seen greater success in the old part of the republic\\n(Wegrich et al. 1997). Possible reasons for this reluctance in pursuing reform\\nare rather unclear. To some extent it can be attributed to existing deficits in\\npersonnel qualifications that still prevail within the new Länder, to the\\nexpected implementation of the ‘old’ Western system of administration and\\nalso partly to extremely critical financial situations. This nevertheless fails to\\nexplain the whole problem (Reichard and Röber 1993).\\nWith regard to the process of ch ange, empirical studies provide some\\nevidence that local authorities experi ence specific problems (Reichard 1997,\\npp. 70ff.) outlined as follows:\\n\\x7f lack of a clear project management  concept including proper project\\nschedule and change strategy;\\n\\x7f weak participation and involvement of  personnel in the change process,\\nfrequently causing de-motivation and poor acceptance of reform issues\\n(for example, nearly 50 per cent of local employees have been found to\\nbe sceptical about the reform process; Grömig 2001, p. 17);\\n\\x7f weak involvement of politicians (members of the local council) within\\nthe entire process of change;\\n\\x7f unsolved conflicts between cost s aving (downsizing) and managerial\\nreform as dominant targets of the reform programme.\\nGerman local governments have inve sted large amounts of human and\\nfinancial capital into reforming thei r managerial structures and concepts'),\n",

After nearly 10 years of implementation, they are still ‘on\\nthe way’; the implementation process is  nowhere near its final stage. The\\nbasic structure of local government still remains the same, but some corrections\\nwith respect to planning, steering, accounting and supervising have been\\nmade. Reforms have been undertaken  solely by the local authorities,\\ntogether with wide-reaching assist ance from consultancy firms. Local\\nauthorities received comparatively little support from the state level. Unlike\\nNPM-implementation in the UK and in some other countries, the design and\\nimplementation of NSM was the sole responsibility of municipal and county\\nadministration within Germany. State authorities gave only limited assist-\\nance, for example, by unlocking regulations (that is, introducing experimental\\nclauses in the local constitutions) or  by awarding reform innovations. The\\nacademic community did not take much  notice of the NSM developments.\\nIn its first years, the NSM debate wa s exclusively driven by practitioners.\\nWith few exceptions, neither political /administrative science nor (business)\\nmanagement academia contributed fu ndamentally to the development of\\nNSM. This situation changed only 3 to  4 years ago; certain parts of the\\nscientific community at least are now participating in discourse on modern-\\nizing (local) government (see Reichard and Wollmann 1996; Grunow and\\nWollmann 1998).\\nAfter 10 years of hectic and ambitious reform activities the main actors are\\nnow rather less enthusiastic and po ssibly more sceptical (Röber 2001).\\nSeveral factors that have possibly contributed to a rise in ‘reform exhaustion’\\nare quite evident, as follows:\\n\\x7f reformers failed to realize that expectations for strong budgetary recovery\\nhastened by the implementation of NSM were to some extent misguided;\\n\\x7f reforms lost their strength due to the one-sided focus on intra-\\nadministrative restructuring as well  as the exclusion more or less of\\nlocal politicians, customer aspects and competitive forces;\\n\\x7f staff has been given mostly a symbolic role in the reform pro cess, with\\nvery little substantial value or impact.\\nEvaluation of the present status of NSM reforms\\nAs in other reforming countries around the world, it is not particularly easy\\nto analyse the measures initiated in German local government. Though\\nNSM-type reforms have already been in place within Germany for a decade\\nnow, it is still difficult to assess th eir results and effects. After 10 years of\\nreforms, there are not many visible results; too much is still moving and is\\n‘on the way’. Furthermore, the generally existing lack of empirical data for\\nidentifying NPM results (see Pollitt and Bouckaert 2000 with their rather\\nsceptical diagnosis of the results and effects of international NPM reforms)\\nis particularly true for Germany. Apart from a few case studies dealing with\\nsingle municipal reform cases and th e already mentioned bi-annual survey\\nconducted by the German associations of  cities, there is nearly no serious'),\n",

On the part of the\\nreforming local governments, there has been no demand for independent\\nevaluations; no municipality has seriously wanted to know about how their\\nreforms were assessed by others. In addition, the public administration-\\nrelated research community in Ge rmany showed little engagement in\\nundertaking comprehensive evaluation studies. Although we are confronted\\nwith challenging problems of measur ement and attribution if we seek to\\nrelate certain reform measures to the ob served results or impacts, it is hard\\nto understand that neither academia nor bureaucracy in Germany have been\\ninterested in learning about the results of their reform efforts.\\nDespite the lack of empirical evaluation, in the case of the German\\nmunicipalities there is some evidence of limited cost-cutting effects after the\\nintroduction of NSM. Savings are primar ily the result of global budgeting,\\nof more flexible financial manageme nt and of introd ucing competitive\\nmechanisms. Some limited efficiency effects are reported from restructuring\\n(flatter hierarchies, merging departments, agencification and contractualiza-\\ntion). Yet some doubts have to be ra ised around transaction costs: new\\ncontractual arrangements such as internal management contracts, purchaser/\\nprovider split, agencification, contract ing-out, and so on, probably cause\\nconsiderable transaction costs, and it must be assumed that these costs are\\nnot recorded in a consistent and reliable manner.\\nAlthough the NSM-type reforms have focused on the internal structures\\nof local government and were with out much relevance for the general\\npublic, it can be assumed that loca l management reforms have had some\\npositive effects on customer satisfac tion. This is partly because numerous\\nmunicipalities have introduced one-stop -offices or have extended their\\nservice portfolios and/or their open ing hours. Another result of NSM\\nimplementation was a stre amlining of decision-making processes, resulting\\nin shorter waiting times for citizens a pplying to receive permits, and so on.\\nLast but not least, citizens observe that the behaviour of public employees is\\nmore consumer-friendly, something which could at least partially be caused\\nby the NSM. A few customer surveys over the last few years show evidence\\nthat the general satisfaction of citizens with local services has increased\\ncompared with data from the early 1990s.\\nWith reference to impacts of NSM re forms on the effectiveness of policy\\nmaking or of service delivery, there is  no clear evidence here. On the one\\nhand it can be assumed that a clear output or outcome focus in local man-\\nagement might improve the quality of policies or services. On the other hand,\\nthere is reason to believe that NSM-type reforms might have some unexpect-\\nedly negative side effects. The following arguments are the subject of frequent\\nacademic debate about NPM and are also relevant in the German case:\\n\\x7f the politics/administration divi de may cause new co-ordination\\nproblems (principal/agent conflicts);'),\n",

There might be some positive effects on efficiency and respon-\\nsiveness but also quite mixed results with regard to the quality and\\neffectiveness of policies and services. If we come to a final assessment of the\\npresent status of NSM refo rms, it can be said that  ‘NSM 1.0’ was a rather\\nnarrow and technocratic approach, base d heavily on internal restructuring\\nand thus neglecting constituencies and stakeholders in local government\\n(particularly citizens, the political fo rces, public and private competitors,\\netc.). It has had some positive impa ct on efficiency and has furthermore\\nprobably contributed to the necessary change of administrative culture in\\nGermany (more managerial flexibility, entrepreneurial attitudes, cost-\\nconscious thinking, and so on). Yet most  observers agree that it is time to\\ndevelop NSM into a more open and ‘s ofter’ version that fundamentally\\nincludes elements of the constituency of the local governments.\\nACTUAL TRENDS AND PERSPECTIVES FOR THE FUTURE\\nGerman municipalities have started to modernize their administration along\\nthe doctrinal lines of NPM in the early 1990s. With the assistance of the KGSt,\\nthey developed at first a rather managerialist and intra-organizational\\n‘model’, ‘NSM 1.0’. Since about 1998, a growing number of local governments\\nwithin Germany have realized that the implementation of the first generation\\nof NSM has not been completely successful, failing to meet all its expectations.\\nThey have therefore begun to enlarg e NSM by adopting several additional\\nelements such as TQM, HRM, strategic management, process re-engineering,\\nmarket-type mechanisms, and so on (s ee p. 389, above). Their aim has been\\nto conceptualize a more comprehensive, less technocratic second generation\\nof NSM (‘NSM 2.0’).\\nHowever, in addition to a ‘rearmam ent’ of the existing NSM various\\n‘new’ topics have come to the fore:\\n\\x7f programmes dealing with enabling and activating citizens, with\\ndevolving local services from admini stration to volu ntary associations\\nor self-help groups (for example, several empowerment activities under\\nthe label of ‘Bürgerkommune’, following the vision of the ‘activating\\nstate’ of the present federal government);\\n\\x7f hybridization and pluralization of institutional arrangements and of\\ngovernance structures (for example, trends to PPP , establishment of'),\n",

Local authorities\\nare in the initial phases of replac ing the antiquated cameralist book-\\nkeeping method – which is still in use in all German public sector\\norganizations – with a modern resource-based, accrual accounting and\\nbudgeting system (Reichard and Bals 2002).\\nCurrently, these topics are being discussed – and partly tested – in a number\\nof communes alongside ongoing NSM innovations. However, at least some\\nlocal authorities try to amalgamate existing NSM elements with selected\\n‘new’ issues. This may in the future lead to a new orientation of the whole\\nreform concept that is less internal and less technocratic. What we can\\nexpect is a more advanced generation  of the NSM which goes beyond the\\nmanagerialist focus of the extended ve rsion of ‘NSM 2.0’. In fact, there is\\nconsiderable room for debate as to whether the ‘NSM’ label is still appropriate\\nfor such future conceptualizations or if it should not be replaced by the more\\nencompassing term ‘local governance’. Such a ‘model’ (‘NSM 3.0’?) should\\nprovide the framework for managing th e entire ‘municipal holding’, with\\nthe core administrative units and all subordinated entities, including corpor-\\nations, utilities and companies. Addition ally, however, it should give room\\nfor the development of sector-specific steering concepts with very particular\\nrequirements, for example, in schools, social services, hospitals, construction,\\nhousing or other public utilities.\\nLOCAL PUBLIC MANAGEMENT REFORMS IN GERMANY, \\nTHE NETHERLANDS AND SWITZERLAND: A COMPARATIVE \\nANALYSIS FROM A GERMAN PERSPECTIVE\\nThere are obviously several similarities between the three countries compared\\nin this volume.

The Netherlands seem\\nrather to rely more dominantly on Anglo-Saxon, mainstream developments.\\nTable 1 describes some similarities and differences between public\\nmanagement reforms in the three countr ies (see also the discussion in the\\nother two articles in this volume). There are of course a lot of dissimilarities:\\nthe three countries have quite different political structures and local govern-\\nment regimes. They rely on divergen t political and administrative cultures\\nand are furthermore different with resp ect to their size. Nevertheless, if we\\ntake a somewhat deeper look at pub lic management reforms of the three\\ncountries in the last 10 years, we ca n identify a number of similarities.\\nReforms have been based – at least partly – on some common doctrines and\\nvisions, and there has also been some exchange of concepts and experiences.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nWith regard to NPM, Germany was a late and relatively hesitant reformer.\\nWhile federal and Länder governments moved relatively modestly from\\ntraditional to ‘new’ models of publ ic management, local government in\\nGermany has been quite active and invented the ‘new steering model’ as the\\ndominant plan for local management. Though not well-known in the rest of\\nthe world, there has been some prog ress in its implementation and some\\nlessons – both positive and negative – to be learned. As in most other cases,\\nhowever, there is no clear picture of  the achieved results and effects in\\nGermany. Due to much rhetoric and poor empirical data, the scope and\\nimpact of local management reforms in Germany is not very apparent. In\\nthe last few years, reformers have slowed down their NPM-type reform\\nprogrammes and have opened up the or iginally narrow reform concept to\\ninclude several ‘beyond-NPM’ issues such as citizen participation and\\nempowerment, e-government or new public governance structures.\\nAlthough Germany has – at least at local levels – moved from its previous\\npattern of a strict, bureaucratic steer ing philosophy by taking some steps\\ntowards the ‘NPM-world’, it nevertheless ‘manifests a significant institutional\\ncontinuity’ and an evident tendency toward path-dependency (Wollmann\\n2000a, p. 932). It certainly maintains a strong tradition based on rule-of-law\\nand its classical reliance on values such  as legality, equality and reliability.\\nThe NSM provides some relaxation of the usual managerial patterns but\\ndoes not present a paradigmatic shift.\\nLooked at as a whole, this series  of articles about The Netherlands,\\nSwitzerland and Germany seems to clearly demonstrate that local public\\nmanagement reforms have some common alities – particularly with respect\\nto content and implementation strate gies. Yet while there was considerable\\ntransfer of knowledge from The Netherlands to Germany and Switzerland\\nin the initial stage of NPM development, reforms within the three countries\\nare clearly discernible from each other.
