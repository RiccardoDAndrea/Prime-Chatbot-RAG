The discovery\\nof reverse transcriptase by Temin and Mizutani8 and Baltimore9, which showed that\\ninformation could be transmitted the other way, from RNA to DNA, had a profound\\ninfluence on medicine but most particularly on cancer medicine.\\nEarly investigators discovered that DNA is a very large molecule that was difficult\\nto study in the laboratory. In 1970, Smith and Wilcox solved this problem by identify-\\ning enzymes that bacteria used defensively to cleave DNA at specific restriction\\nsites.10 These discoveries gave birth to the molecular revolution and the biotechnol-\\nogy industry. They also paved the way for the sequencing of the genome.\\nThis kind of science was expensive. The U.S. Congress partially addressed the\\nproblem by passing the National Cancer Act, which expanded the role of the Na-\\ntional Cancer Institute (NCI), the first disease-oriented agency at the National\\nInstitutes of Health (NIH). The act, which was signed into law on December 23,\\n1971, by President Richard Nixon, created a new mandate for an NIH institute: “to\\nsupport research and the application of the results of research to reduce the inci-\\ndence, morbidity and mortality from cancer.” The emphasis on the application of\\nthe results of research was new; it had not been in the mission statement of the\\nNIH. The act would quintuple the budget of the NCI by the end of the decade and\\nprovide the fuel for the revolution in molecular biology.\\nAlthough the enthusiasm in Congress for eradicating cancer was largely derived\\nfrom excitement over a few clinical advances, about 85% of these new funds went to\\nsupport basic research. At its peak in the early 1980s, the NCI accounted for 23%\\nn engl j med 366;23 nejm.org june 7, 2012 2207\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org on February 11, 2025.
